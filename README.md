# CribbageTrainer
Implement scoring and logging

This was a group project done in 2021 which used the java language, and helped build skills in proper design, architecture and protected variation. 
A version of the [Cribbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage) game was given to us, and we had to implement scoring and logging functions while 
maintaining low coupling and high cohesion, and ensuring protected variation was maintained. To achieve this we used the GRASP patterns as well as 
GoF patterns, as highlighted in the report.
